## Welcome to the DISNEY CHARACTER SEARCH TOOL! ♫
You can access the website **[HERE!](http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-raquelgarciat/)**
The page shows a limited set of Disney characters using the [Disney API](https://disneyapi.dev/).

 - You can search for a specific character in the list using the **search bar**. 
 - If you click on a character, it will be automatically included inside a **favorite list** (on the left).
 - If you click on it again, it will be **removed** from the favorite section.
 - Please note the favorite section will be cached in your **local storage**, so every time you reload the page, your favorites will be right there waiting for you.
 - Clicking on the **clear all** button at the bottom of the favorite section will make your favorites magically disappear.

Happy Disney characters browsing! ♪
